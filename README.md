The two datasets, DS1 (Statlog Heart dataset) and DS2 (Heart Disease Data Set), are related but distinct. DS1 is a subset of DS2 and is cleaner with no missing values, while DS2 includes more comprehensive data across different locations but contains missing values. Hereâ€™s how you could approach this task:

1) Start with DS1 (Statlog Heart dataset):

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use DS1 to explore basic statistical properties. This can include:
- Summary statistics: Mean, median, mode, etc., for each attribute.
- Probability distributions: Plot histograms or kernel density plots to observe the distribution of each attribute.
- Correlation analysis: Use a correlation matrix to assess relationships between attributes, possibly identifying attributes that might be more important for clustering or classification.
- Clustering: Run clustering algorithms (like k-means or hierarchical clustering) on DS1 after scaling the data to check for any natural clusters within the data.



2) Move to DS2 (Heart Disease Data Set):

##### Explore processed datasets: Start by analyzing the processed.location.data files. These have the same 14 attributes as DS1, allowing you to extend your analysis from DS1.
- Missing values handling: Check for and handle missing values in the larger dataset. You can try imputation techniques or drop rows/columns depending on the amount of missing data.
- Compare datasets from different locations: Explore the differences between the datasets from various locations. You could:
- Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to see if there are significant differences in attributes across locations.
- Visualize the data to highlight location-based differences.
- Main body of work on DS2: Since DS2 contains more diverse data, after handling missing values, extend your EDA and clustering efforts. If you find that there are location-specific patterns, that might guide further analysis or modeling.



## Task Clarification:

The file names (location.data, processed.location.data) correspond to different levels of preprocessing:

location.data: The full, unprocessed datasets with missing values and additional attributes.

processed.location.data: The 14 attributes matching DS1 with fewer missing values, suitable for immediate use.

##### Workflow Summary:

- EDA on DS1 (start with clean data, visualize, and cluster).
- Extend EDA to DS2: Handle missing data, compare across locations, and investigate the larger dataset.
- Generate insights: Summarize your findings in terms of the distributions, correlations, and any clusters or location-based differences. Use your visualizations and statistical tests to guide the report.
- This approach will help break down the task systematically while ensuring you address both datasets comprehensively.
